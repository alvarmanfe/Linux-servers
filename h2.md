## x)
The command line used in Linux is one of the most valuable tools for a software engineer.

List of commands:
- pwd (print working directory): prints where I currently am in the file system
- cd (change directory): allows us to change directories (move from one directory to another)
  - cd .. : change directory up
- ls: lists the directory’s contents; Use that if shell says "No such file or directory"
  - ls -a: lists all files and directories
  - ls -l displays the list of files in a long format
- mkdir: make a new directory, create new directories
- rmdir: remove a directory
- nano, pico: text editors
- cp: copy
- rm: remove -> Think before using! Remove the file directly without any trash
- mv: move or rename directory
- -r: recursive
- ssh: (like $ ssh alvar@example.com) open a remote command shell in a very secure way. Opens a remote machine where you can type commands
  exit: exit back to your own machine
  scp: securely copy folder to a folder in remote machine
- man ls: show a manual page of commands
- tab button: guess most of the commands -> very useful tool!
- history: shows all the commands I have run recently

- sudo apt-get update: update list of available packages
- sudo apt-get -y install: install software. You can install at same time different softwares only listing them with a space between
- sudo apt-get purge: used to remove the software

## a) Micro
- Installed Micro-editor with typing in the Linux Terminal: $ sudo apt-get -y install micro
- Verificated the version of micro with command $ micro --version

## b) Apt
Install 3 command line programs at same time:
1) run $ sudo apt update and then $ sudo apt install -y htop ncdu fastfetch

![Sieppaa1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4389b2-c004-4d13-a6dc-55f1463a8000)

2) tryed all of this programs and their main functionalities:
- htop -> real time CPU usage, memory consumption and running processes
![Sieppaa2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dda1ad1-f896-44b4-9f12-abd63e06e6eb)

- ncdu -> fast identification of large directories and files
![Sieppaa3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9639249d-4087-4f7f-a003-7ccb64683fac)

- fastfetch -> collects and displays system details such as: operating system and kernel, CPU and GPU, memory usage, disk information uptime and package count
![Sieppaa4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258455ad-f6fc-4be0-b83f-7821000a7396)

## c) FHS

- Root directory / -> Top-level directory of the Linux filesystem. All other directories originate from this.
  - run with $ ls -la /
![Sieppaa5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c724c3-bc57-402a-b45b-158cf46e17d8)

- /home -> Contains home directories for all users.
![Sieppaa6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d32f2bb0-9303-4346-9714-7ebaedc429ac)

- /home/alvar -> Home directory of user "alvar" (personal home directory). The only place where user "alvar" can permanently store data.
![Sieppaa7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07a2305f-d953-4c8b-8369-6e1ca83a1618)

- /etc -> system configuration and wide settings. On modern unix systems, almost all system-wide configuration files are under /etc, but not all files in /etc are configuration files. Usually plain text fails.
$ ls -la /etc -> $ cat /etc/hostname     The hostname file defines the system’s network name.
![Sieppaa12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ad71c31-86ba-4fbb-af08-5c5e3598f345)
![Sieppaa13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772c04bd-34b6-49ec-b46f-c0de3c1f5fbe)

   
- /media -> removable media mount point (for removable storage like USB drives or ext hard disks.
![Sieppaa11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bdab845-d44d-4922-8b23-85b19ddf35cc)
   
- /var/log -> special directory for storing system and service logs. It records events, errors, warnings, and other important information about your operating system and applications.cd
![Sieppaa14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a91e73-9bbf-45b4-9882-8ac18692b679)
Here we can see all last 20 logs

## d) The Friendly M.
The command grep is used to search for specific words, phrases, or patterns inside text files, and shows the matching lines on your screen. It can return the lines where it finds a match or the lines where it doesn't.
Examples:
$ grep "root" /etc/passwd  ->  open the file /etc/passwd and display all the lines that contain the word "root".
$ grep -r "network" /etc (2>/dev/null)  ->  search the word "network" in all files in the /etc directory and subdirectories and print the line where found.

## e) Pipes
Used when you want to communicate between 2 processes. In the example I show you below you can see how we can write multiple commands on the same line using pipes.
![Sieppaa16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c015eed0-230c-4240-900f-1b8977fe6357)

## f) Rauta
First we install lshw running first $ sudo apt-get update. Then $ sudo apt-get install lshw.
![Sieppaa17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f43ac7b-d79e-4bf7-b8dc-9eba802de72a)
Then we run: $ sudo lshw -short -sanitize
![Sieppaa18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd3198d3-09f6-4bca-a1dd-f7a0acdcab83)
The command lshw is used to generate detailed reports about various hardware components on the system. In this case -short (that we used to run the command) is used to give as a brief information report of the hadware and give us a quickly idea about the hardware profile of the system. The command -sanitize hides sensitive or unique identifiers (like serial numbers).
In the table we got we can see different columns:

  - H/W path: hardware location in the system tree
  - Device: Linux device file
  - Class: type of hardware
  - Description

Analysis:
- First we can see our current OS is running on Virtual Machine (VirtualBox)
- The virtual machine is using the CPU of the host (Intel Core i7-11700K....) and has 4GB   of RAM memory as we assigned that quantity during the installation
- 64GB Virtual Disk with a partition
- Most of the inputs (mouse, keyboard...) are passed from the host
